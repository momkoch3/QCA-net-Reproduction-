# QCA-net-Reproduction-
This repository contains all the files used to reproduce Figure 3 from the paper:  3D convolutional neural networks-based segmentation to acquire quantitative criteria of the nucleus during mouse embryogenesis (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-020-00152-8)

The Training notebook files themselves contain all the necessary pre-processing steps and the architecture of a single network. The training loop can also be found in these files.
The post-processing_Watershed_Image_plot file contains the post-processing process which includes re-interpolation and application of the watershed algorithm.

We also wanted to upload the trained networks, but alas these files were too big to upload.
